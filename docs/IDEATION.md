# Rynk Ideas - Ideation & workflows

## Philosophy
Rynk Ideas is built for **"Deep Work"**. Unlike generic chatbots, it maintains infinite context and allows for structured, project-based workflows.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Infinite Memory
- Every conversation is indexed.
- Use `@` to cite ANY past conversation.
- "Project Brain" enables the AI to learn from all files and chats in a workspace simultaneously.

### 2. Deep Research
- **Standard Mode**: Quick answers.
- **Deep Research Mode**: The AI autonomously:
    - Queries multiple external sources (Search, Academic, News).
    - Synthesizes findings.
    - Provides citation-backed answers.

### 3. Ideation Workflow
1.  **Project Setup**: Create a project (e.g., "New SaaS App"). Add context/instruction (e.g., "Stack: Next.js, Stripe").
2.  **Brainstorming**: Start a chat "Feature Brainstorming". Iterate on ideas.
3.  **Branching**: Use **Message Versioning** to explore diverging paths (e.g., "What if we used SQL?" vs "What if we used NoSQL?").
4.  **Sub-Chats**: Deep dive on specific points (e.g., select "Auth flow" -> "Start sub-chat") without cluttering the main ideation thread.

## Usage Guide
- **`⌘K`**: Global search & navigation.
- **`@`**: Context picker (Files, Folders, Chats).
- **Edit & Branch**: Click edit on any message to fork the conversation.
